# Vulkan Based Rendering Engine
Toy engine project to learn Vulkan and advanced rendering techniques.

## Features:
* Abstraction layer
* PBR based opaque surface shading
* Image based lighting
* HDR textures
* Cascaded shadow maps
* Parallax occlusion mapping with self shadowing

## To explore/implement next:
* Simple editor
* Omnidirectional shadow maps
* Global illumination
* Non pre-baked reflections
* Depth prepass
* Clustered forward rendering
* GTAO
* Bloom
* Subsurface scattering
* Volumetric clouds
* Automatic texture transition barriers
